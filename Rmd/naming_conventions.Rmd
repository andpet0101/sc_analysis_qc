* Sample names should have the following format:
    * **Name**\_**PlateNumber**\_**Row****Col**
    * **PlateNumber** is the number of the plate done in the experiment without leading zeros
    * **Row** is the row in the plate and can be A-H
    * **Col** is the column in the plate and can be 1-12 without leading zeros

    * RNA or UHR: positive control with RNA as material
